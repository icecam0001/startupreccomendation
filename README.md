## The Problem
One of the biggest problems in the CS community is the struggle to get experience. The field is saturated, and actual experience from internships is incredibly difficult to get - there just aren't enough spots. It creates this frustrating cycle where companies want interns with experience while simultaneously preventing those developers from getting it. 

There's no shortage of open-source projects on GitHub that need contributors, but there's no streamlined platform for posting and discovering these opportunities. I'm hoping this system not only helps developers find projects to contribute to but also encourages more people to build and share cool things together. I'm hoping in a couple months when this project materializes, we might see an increase in the total number of open-source projects instead of the current negative feedback loop where finding projects is as hard as finding contributors.

## How It All Fits Together
The platform uses different recommendation approaches for different parts of the user experience:

### Main Page Recommendations
- **Content-Based Tag Recommender**: Heavily weighted for newer users who do not have enough data to calculate accurate CF recommendations. In the beginning users select tags they are interested (which will slowly decay with time), but in the intermediary, the system uses case-based recommendations to help developers find projects matching their skill level and interests:
```python
user_tag_dict[user_id][project_tag] += 1/(math.log(len(project_dict[project_id]['tag'])))
```

- **Item-Item Collaborative Filtering**: Creates recommendations through project similarity analysis:
```python
# Precomputed similarities for top projects
projectssorted = precomputesimilarities(projectdict, itemdict, 100)

# Dynamic calculation for less common projects
def calculate_combined_item(item1, item2, itemintdict, project_dict, project_weight=0.5, tag_weight=0.5):
    project_similarity = calculate_similarity_binary(
        itemintdict[item1],
        itemintdict[item2]
    )
    tag_similarity = calculate_similarity_tags(
        project_dict[item1]['tags'],
        project_dict[item2]['tags']
    )
    return (project_weight * project_similarity) + (tag_weight * tag_similarity)
```

- **User-User Collaborative Filtering**: The main recommendation algorithm. It uses two different similarity calculations:
  - TFIDF-weighted allows for tags who are not used often to have a higher weight when compared to tags applied to almost every item. (Python vs Distilled Learning). These low frequency items allow for more insight into a users interests and thus are weighted higher
  - Standard weighting to ensure even heavily-tagged projects still have weight in recommendations
  - Normalize by contributor count to prevent popularity bias:
```python
for item in scoreneighborhood:
    scoreneighborhood[item] = scoreneighborhood[item]/math.sqrt(projectdict[item]['contributor_count'])
```

### Project Page Recommendations
- **Association Rule Mining**: Similar to Amazon's "People who bought this also bought". When viewing a project, it shows related projects based on co-contribution patterns:
```python
def recommend(self, project_id, numberofrecs=10, lowoccpenalty=0.5):
    totals = {}
    probability = {}
    
    for i in userinteractiondict:
        if project_id in userinteractiondict[i]:
            for x in userinteractiondict[i]:
                totals[x] = totals.get(x, 0) + 1
                if x != project_id:
                    probability[x] = probability.get(x, 0) + 1
        else:
            for x in userinteractiondict[i]:
                totals[x] = totals.get(x, 0) + 1

    projectprobabiliy = totals.get(project_id, 0)
    
    for i in probability:
        probability[i] = (probability[i]/projectprobabiliy) * (1 - math.exp(-probability[i]*lowoccpenalty))
```
- Uses monotonic confidence attenuation to handle rare co-occurrences
- Implemented an exponential penalty factor to balance common and rare associations

### Learning Path
- **Trending Score Algorithm**: Powers a dedicated page for solo projects that are good for learning:
```python
def rank_projects(self, gravity=1.5, top_n=10):
    ranking = {}
    for i in projectinteractiondict:
        if projectinteractiondict[i]["solo"] == True:
            post_timestamp = datetime.datetime.strptime(
                projectinteractiondict[i]["created_timestamp"], 
                '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'
            )
            hours_since_post = (datetime.datetime.now() - post_timestamp).total_seconds() / 3600
            post_interactions = projectinteractiondict[i]["contributor_count"]
            ranking[i] = math.log10(post_interactions)/(hours_since_post**gravity)
```
- Focuses on solo projects posted to help new users learn
- Uses time decay to keep content new
- Helps create a stepping stone for new users to ease into contributing

## Technical Implementation Details

### Core Similarity Calculations
The system implements several similarity metrics:

1. Binary Interaction Similarity:
```python
def calculate_similarity_binary(vec1, vec2):
    dotproduct = 0
    for g in vec1:
        if g in vec2:
            dotproduct += 1
    magnitude1 = math.sqrt(len(vec1))  
    magnitude2 = math.sqrt(len(vec2))  
    if magnitude1 * magnitude2 == 0:
        return 0
    return dotproduct/(magnitude2*magnitude1)
```

2. Tag-Based TFIDF Similarity:
```python
def calculate_similarity_tags(user_tag_profile1, user_tag_profile2):
    dotproduct = 0
    for tag in user_tag_profile1:
        if tag in user_tag_profile2:
            dotproduct += user_tag_profile2[tag] * user_tag_profile1[tag]
    
    magnitude1 = math.sqrt(sum(value**2 for value in user_tag_profile1.values()))
    magnitude2 = math.sqrt(sum(value**2 for value in user_tag_profile2.values()))
    
    if magnitude1 * magnitude2 == 0:
        return 0
    return dotproduct / (magnitude2 * magnitude1)
```

3. Hybrid Approach With Weights For Each
```python
def calculate_combined_similarity(user1, user2, user_interaction_dict, user_tag_dict, 
                                project_weight=0.5, tag_weight=0.5):
    project_similarity = calculate_similarity_binary(
        user_interaction_dict[user1],
        user_interaction_dict[user2]
    )
    tag_similarity = calculate_similarity_tags(
        user_tag_dict[user1],
        user_tag_dict[user2]
    )
    return (project_weight * project_similarity) + (tag_weight * tag_similarity)
```

### Performance Optimizations

1. Precomputed Similarities:
```python
def precomputesimilarities(projectdict, numberofprecomputes, itemintdict):
    projectdictsorted = dict(sorted(projectdict.items(), 
                           key=lambda x: x[1]['contributor_count'], 
                           reverse=True))
    relationshipdict = {}
    g = 0
    for i in projectdictsorted:
        g += 1
        if g >= numberofprecomputes:
            break
        relationshipdict[i] = {}
        for k in projectdict:
            try:
                relationshipdict[i][k] = relationshipdict[k][i]
            except:
                if k == i:
                    continue
                relationshipdict[i][k] = calculate_combined_item(
                    k, i, itemintdict, projectdict, 0.7, 0.3)
    return relationshipdict
```

2. Optimizations:
- Compute full similarities only when needed
- Cache popular project relationships
- Normalize user data: users who like many items naturally provide less information about each

### Cold Start Handling
- Realistic interaction patterns in a baseline dataset
- Balanced distribution across project types
- Time-based contribution patterns

### Data Structures
Projects and interactions use these structures:
```python
project = {
    'id': 'proj001',
    'tags': ['web', 'react'],
    'contributor_count': 45,
    'created_timestamp': '2024-01-01-14:30:00',
    'solo': True
}

interaction = {
    'user_id': 'user001',
    'project_id': 'proj001',
    'timestamp': '2024-01-01-15:30:00'
}
```

## Usage
Each recommender can be used on its own:
```python
# For trending projects
ranker = TrendingReccomender()
trending_projects = ranker.rank_projects(gravity=1.5, top_n=10)

# For project recommendations
recommender = AssociationRulesRecommender()
recommendations = recommender.recommend(project_id, numberofrecs=10)

# For item-based recommendations
item_recommender = ItemSimilarityRecommender()
similar_projects = item_recommender.recommend(project_id, n=5)
```


## Technical Implementation Notes
- Built functions for data loading and similarity calculations
- Implemented caching for similarity matrices where needed
- Handled edge cases like empty vectors
- Normalized vectors in similarity calculations
- Designed for modularity to test different approaches
- Added synthetic data patterns for cold-start handling
- Implemented sparse optimizations for large-scale calculations

The core recommendation engine is working, with each algorithm serving a cool purpose! The focus has been on creating a system that guides developers from learning to contributing while also helping project owners find the perfect contributors.
